### About
While I was at a code camp in Minneapolis this weekend, several of my peers told me I could quickly spin up an FAQ bot, which would be far more interesting (and interactive) than a boring FAQ page. They said it could be done in minutes, and I was up for a challenge, so off we went. By the end of the process, I was pleasantly surprised, and had converted my entire FAQ into a chat bot in less than 15 minutes. Check it out here.

The details are as follows:

	1. Head to https://qnamaker.ai/ to your QnA service (FAQ)
	2. Register your empty bot with Microsoft to generate a new App ID and password
	3. Create an Azure Bot
	4. Test it out locally
	5. Locate your KnowledgeBaseID
	6. Host your bot on a web server
	7. Test your QnA service in the cloud
  8. Integrate your bot into a chat service

Thanks to Sarah Sexton (@Saelia), Hao Luo (@howlowck), & Kevin Leung (@KSLHacks) for helping me put this together!
